    "text": "With the exciting wrap-up of the 2022 World Athletics Championships1 in Eugene, Oregon, this July, I thought it would be a good time to release this long-awaited (by me) blog post. This is my first post- I don’t know how regularly I’ll update here, but this blog should be a good place to keep track of any fun or interesting projects I work on.\nIn September of 2020, I submitted my first R package combinedevents to CRAN2. In this post, I am going to demonstrate how the package works and touch on the finer details of the package (like a vignette would), but first I’ll introduce what combined events are in track and field."

    "text": "What are combined events?\nCombined events (or multi-events) are competitions in which athletes compete in multiple track and field events encompassing running, jumping, and throwing. Athletes earn points for their performance in each event, and at the end of the competition the summed points across all events gives the total score. The winner is the athlete with the highest point total.\nTrack and field competitions are held both outdoors and indoors. In indoor track and field, the track is typically 200 meters, half the size of a standard outdoor track, and many of the contested events differ from those held outdoors. The most common outdoor combined events are the men’s decathlon and the women’s heptathlon, while the most common indoor combined events are the men’s heptathlon and women’s pentathlon. Each of these combined events are detailed in the tables below.\n\nOutdoor combined events\n\nMen’s decathlon\nThe men’s decathlon consists of 10 events competed over 2 days in the following order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Decathlon events\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Day 1\n      Day 2\n    \n  \n  \n    100 meters\n110 meters hurdles\n    Long jump\nDiscus throw\n    Shot put\nPole vault\n    High jump\nJavelin throw\n    400 meters\n1500 meters\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen’s heptathlon\nThe women’s heptathlon consists of 7 events competed over 2 days in the following order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Heptathlon events\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Day 1\n      Day 2\n    \n  \n  \n    100 meters hurdles\nLong jump\n    High jump\nJavelin throw\n    Shot put\n800 meters\n    200 meters\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndoor combined events\n\nMen’s heptathlon\nThe men’s heptathlon consists of 7 events over 2 days in the following order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Heptathlon events\n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Day 1\n      Day 2\n    \n  \n  \n    60 meters\n60 meters hurdles\n    Long jump\nPole vault\n    Shot put\n1000 meters\n    High jump\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen’s pentathlon\nThe women’s pentathlon is a one-day competition consisting of 5 events in the following order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Pentathlon events\n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    60 meters hurdles\n\n    High jump\n\n    Shot put\n\n    Long jump\n\n    800 meters"

    "text": "How are combined events scored?\nThe number of points athletes earn in each event is based on a set of scoring tables created by the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF), now known as World Athletics3.\nThese scoring tables are progressive, which means that\n\nAccomplishing more difficult feats will earn you more points.\nEqual improvements in performance (e.g., a half-second improvement in 100m time) are not rewarded equally. To elaborate further with the 100m example, even though going from 11.5 to 11 seconds has the same half-second improvement as going from 11 to 10.5 seconds, the increase in points scored for the latter is greater because the latter performance is more difficult for sprinters to achieve. Essentially, the scoring tables reflect the fact that it’s harder to make performance gains as you approach the limits of human performance."
